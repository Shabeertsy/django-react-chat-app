React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily focused on creating interactive, single-page applications. Here are some key points about React:

    Component-Based: React follows a component-based architecture, where you build your application by creating reusable components. These components can be as simple as a button or as complex as an entire page.

    Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize and improve the performance of updates. It calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM, reducing the need for direct manipulation.

    Declarative: React allows you to describe how your UI should look based on the application's state. It abstracts away the low-level DOM manipulation, making it easier to understand and maintain your code.
